I am a master's student in Computer Science at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. My interests lie in the fields of theoretical machine learning and optimization. I am also interested in creating new and efficient learning algorithms for large datasets. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Christopher Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/).

Before coming to NYU, I worked as a software engineer at HSBC, Pune. I completed my bachelor's in Computer Engineering from PICT, Pune.
