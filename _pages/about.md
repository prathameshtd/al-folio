I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science at Rutgers University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jie Gao](https://sites.rutgers.edu/jie-gao/about/) and be a part of the [Theory group](https://theory.cs.rutgers.edu/).

My research interests lie (very) broadly in the fields of algorithms and learning theory. My current research involves topics in differential privacy.

Before joining Rutgers, I completed my Master's in CS at NYU Tandon School of Engineering during which I was lucky to have the opportunity to work with [Prof. Christopher Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/). I obtained my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from PICT, Pune after which I worked at HSBC, Pune as a software engineer.

Apart from research, I enjoy video games and traveling. I also have a new found fondness for hiking.
